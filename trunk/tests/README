Before starting, copy tests-setpath.php.dist to tests-setpath.php, and 
tests-config.php.dist to tests-config.php.  Then make sure the contents 
of each are correct.

To run all tests, execute:

    pear run-tests

To run selected tests, execte:

    pear run-tests <filename> [<filename>] ...

Note that some tests require previous tests to be run for them to work
properly.
